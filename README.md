# Web Scraping All Dog Food Products on Chewy.com

Scrapy is a great tool within Python to extract information from websites when the data does not exist. 

In the chewy folder, my code can extract dog food product information on chewy.com. Brand name, date of review, number of reviews, percent of recommendation, sale price, product name, product review content, review rating score and review title are extracted. 

With information extracted, I analyzed data to answer below questionns. 
1.How dog food products on Chewy.com perform in past few years based on customer reviews?
2.How can chewy receive better customer reviews?
